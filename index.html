I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from [Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

    [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"

Fancy Tables
You can specify alignment for each column in a table by adding colons to separator lines. A colon at the left of the separator will make the column aligned to the left, a colon on the right of the line will make the column aligned to the right. Colons at both side means the column is aligned to the center.

                                | Item      | Value |
                                | --------- | -----:|
                                | iPad      | $160  |
                                | iPhone    | $12   |
                                | iMac      | $1340 |   
         
        
Will output something like this
Item	Value
iPad	$160
iPhone	$12
iMac	$1340
Backslash Escapes
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown's formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word with asterisks, you can use backslashes before the asterisks, like this:

                    \*literal asterisks\*
            
Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

                    \   backslash
                    `   backtick
                    *   asterisk
                    _   underscore
                    {}  curly braces
                    []  square brackets
                    ()  parentheses
                    #   hash mark
                    +   plus sign
                    -   minus sign (hyphen)
                    .   dot
                    !   exclamation mark
